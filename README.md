# Calculator 

This is a simple calculator which support trigonometric functions.
The result of any trigonometric function is in radian by default.

### Weirdness 
It is mandatory that binary operators be used where they ought to be used.
For instance, calculations like the one below won't work, though its a common mathematics syntax.
```
5Cos(23)
3sin(30)

```
The above expression ahould written as 
```
5xCos(23)
3xsin(30)
```
respectively.
